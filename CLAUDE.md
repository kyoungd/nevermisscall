# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is the **NeverMissCall Phase 1** implementation - a focused call management system that turns missed calls into SMS conversations with AI assistance and seamless human handoff. Phase 1 delivers a complete, working system for small market deployment.

## Phase 1 Scope

**Current Focus**: Building the core working system (4-6 weeks)
- Business onboarding and phone number provisioning
- Missed call to SMS conversion with AI processing  
- Real-time dashboard with conversation management
- Manual takeover from AI conversations
- Basic lead tracking and appointment scheduling

**Excluded from Phase 1**: Advanced analytics, business intelligence, multi-user support, billing systems, phone number compliance features

## Development Philosophy

Our market is small, so we prioritize simplicity and working functionality over complex optimizations:

- **Clean, Readable Code** - Prioritize clarity and maintainability
- **Coding Best Practices** - Strict adherence to best practice standards
- **Easy Implementation** - Simple setup for end users
- **Straightforward Architecture** - Avoid over-engineering
- **Functionality First** - Focus on working features over performance optimization
- **Documentation-Driven** - All implementation follows detailed specifications

## CRITICAL: AI Code Generation Standards

**MANDATORY READING**: All AI-generated code MUST follow the comprehensive guidelines in `/documentation-requirement.md`.

### Key AI Development Requirements:
- **Honest Failure Over Eager Passing**: Tests must validate actual behavior, not just pass
- **Business Logic Focus**: Code must solve real business problems with proper error handling
- **Three-Tier Testing**: Unit, Integration, and E2E tests with meaningful validation
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Code must understand and enforce business rules
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Clear business context and purpose in all implementations

### Before Writing Any Code:
1. **Always check the /docs folder first** - Review all relevant documentation in docs/architecture/, docs/services/phase-1/, and docs/overview/ before implementing anything
2. **Read existing patterns** in the codebase and follow them exactly
3. **Ask: "What real bug would this catch?"** for all tests and validations
4. **Include error conditions and edge cases** in all implementations
5. **Write domain-specific, testable code** that integrates with business workflows
6. **Document business context** and integration points clearly

**Reference Documents:**
- `/documentation-requirement.md` - Core development and testing standards
- `/documentation-prerelease.md` - Performance and security requirements for production

This ensures AI-generated code provides genuine business value rather than just passing tests.

### Service Communication Pattern
```
Customer Call → twilio-server → as-call-service → dispatch-bot-ai
                      ↓              ↓                ↓
                  web-ui ← as-connection-service ← Real-time Events
                      ↓              ↓                ↓
            ts-auth-service ← Authentication    as-analytics-core-service
                      ↓              ↓                ↓
            ts-tenant-service ← Business Config  as-alerts-service ← Monitoring
                      ↓              ↓                ↓
            ts-user-service ← User Data         as-infrastructure-service
                      ↓              ↓                ↓
            ts-config-service ← Settings       universal-calendar ← Scheduling
                      ↓              ↓
            pns-provisioning-service ← Phone Setup
                      ↓
                database-service ← Data Layer
```

### Service Dependencies & Communication Flow:
- **Authentication Flow**: ts-auth-service → ts-tenant-service → ts-user-service
- **Business Logic**: as-call-service ↔ dispatch-bot-ai ↔ universal-calendar
- **Real-time Updates**: as-connection-service ← all services (events)
- **Analytics Pipeline**: as-analytics-core-service ← as-call-service ← as-alerts-service
- **Infrastructure**: as-infrastructure-service monitors all services
- **Data Layer**: database-service provides repository patterns for all services

### Service-to-Service Authentication

**Fixed API Key Authentication**: All internal service-to-service communication uses a shared API key for authentication.

- **Header**: `x-service-key: nmc-internal-services-auth-key-phase1`
- **Environment Variable**: `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY=nmc-internal-services-auth-key-phase1`
- **Usage**: Required for all internal endpoints (`/internal/*`)
- **Security**: Services validate this key before processing internal requests

### Shared Library Architecture
- **Shared Database Access**: All services use the shared `shared/database` library
- **Simple Connection Pool**: Single connection pool managed by shared library
- **Schema Migrations**: File-based migrations managed via `node migrate.js` command
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Basic tenant isolation in shared queries

### Data Flow
```
Services → shared/database → PostgreSQL
Services → shared/config → Common Configuration
Services → shared/utils → Common Utilities
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple file-based sharing (no published packages)
- Consistent database access patterns
- Shared configuration and utilities
- Easy schema migrations and updates

## Shared Library Usage

### Database Operations
```python
from shared import init_database, query, health_check
import os

# Initialize database connection
db = init_database(url=os.getenv('DATABASE_URL'))
await db.connect()

# Simple queries
users = await query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE tenant_id = %s', [tenant_id])
is_healthy = await health_check()
```

### Configuration
```python
from shared import get_common_config, SERVICE_PORTS, get_service_url

config = get_common_config()
auth_service_url = get_service_url('ts-auth-service')
```

### Common Types & Utilities
```python
from shared import ApiResponse, success_response, error_response, logger, validate_required

# API responses
return success_response(user_data, 'User retrieved successfully')

# Logging
logger.info('Service started', extra={'port': config.port})

# Validation
validate_required(email, 'email')
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Check migration status
node migrate.js status

# Run pending migrations  
node migrate.js migrate

# Create new migration
node migrate.js create "add user preferences table"
```

## Phase 1 Implementation Guidelines

### Core Development Principles

1. **Documentation-First Development**
   - All services have complete design specifications in `docs/services/phase-1/`
   - API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic fully documented
   - Implementation must strictly follow design documents

2. **Working System Focus**  
   - Each service group delivers working functionality
   - Weekly milestones with testable outcomes
   - Complete user journey: Registration → Onboarding → Live Conversations

3. **Simple & Reliable**
   - Clear service boundaries with single responsibilities
   - Direct service-to-service communication
   - Basic error handling with proper logging
   - No premature optimization

4. **Test-Driven Quality**
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Standard Development Commands

#### Database Management
```bash
# Check migration status
python migrate.py status

# Run pending migrations
python migrate.py migrate

# Create new migration
python migrate.py create "add user preferences table"
```

#### Service Development
```bash
# Each service directory
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 3801  # Development mode
python main.py        # Production mode
python -m unittest discover tests/  # Run unit tests
python -m unittest discover tests/ -v  # Run unit tests with verbose output
```

#### Shared Library Integration
All services must use the shared library:
```python
from shared import init_database, get_common_config, logger, success_response
```

**Next Phases**: After Phase 1 completion, expand to advanced analytics (Phase 2) and enterprise features (Phase 3) based on market feedback and business requirements.

**Development Focus**: Build Phase 1 completely before considering Phase 2 features. Each service must be production-ready with proper testing, monitoring, and documentation.
