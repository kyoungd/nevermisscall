| **TOTAL** | **34/34** | ✅ | **Complete Core Coverage** |

## 🎯 **Core Functionality Tested**

### **Service Monitoring Logic** ✅
- Health status determination based on HTTP status and response time
- Service registry configuration for all Phase 1 services  
- Critical service identification and dependency tracking
- Alert threshold validation and escalation logic

### **Configuration Management** ✅
- Service registry with 9+ configured services
- Alert thresholds for response time and error rates
- Service dependencies and critical path determination
- Environment variable handling and defaults

### **Data Models & Validation** ✅
- HealthCheckResult, ServiceHealth, ServiceMetrics models
- Pydantic validation for required/optional fields
- API response formatting (success/error)
- Alert model structure and validation

### **Metrics & Analytics** ✅  
- Percentile calculations (P50, P95, P99)
- Uptime percentage calculations
- URL parsing and port extraction
- Request metrics and availability tracking

## 🚀 **Testing Approach: No Over-Engineering**

Following the "not over engineer" requirement, the tests focus on:

### ✅ **What IS Tested** (Essential Business Logic):
- **Core service monitoring functions** - Status determination, registry validation
- **Configuration correctness** - Service registry, dependencies, thresholds
- **Data model validation** - Pydantic models, required fields, API responses  
- **Business rule enforcement** - Alert thresholds, critical path services
- **Essential calculations** - Percentiles, uptime, URL parsing

### ❌ **What is NOT Tested** (Over-Engineering Avoided):
- External HTTP calls to actual services (mocked/avoided)
- Redis connection and storage (integration level)
- Complex async workflows (simplified for unit tests)
- Full FastAPI application startup (isolated functions)
- Database connections or migrations (no DB in this service)
