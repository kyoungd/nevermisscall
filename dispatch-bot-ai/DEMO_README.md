# Never Missed Call AI - Interactive Demo Console

## Quick Start

1. **Run the demo:**
   ```bash
   ./run_demo.sh
   ```

2. **Or manually:**
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src ./venv/bin/python demo_console.py
   ```

## How It Works

The demo console simulates a real customer calling your plumbing business. You type messages as the customer would, and the AI processes them through the complete Never Missed Call system:

1. **Message Parsing** - AI understands the problem and extracts key information
2. **Address Validation** - Checks if the location is in your service area  
3. **Appointment Scheduling** - Offers available time slots with cost estimates
4. **Conversation Management** - Handles multi-turn dialogues naturally
