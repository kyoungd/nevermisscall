## Summary

These examples show how the Dispatch Bot AI API handles:

**Happy Paths:**
- Same-day emergency booking with immediate confirmation
- Next-day standard appointment with tentative hold
- Time-aware travel calculation considering rush hour traffic
- Clear communication with appropriate pricing

**Unhappy Paths:**
- Geographic limitations (out of service area)
- Travel time/distance constraint violations
- Low confidence/unclear messages requiring clarification
- Capacity constraints leading to alternative offers
- Emergency situations during off-hours
- Address validation failures
- Customer abandonment scenarios

**New Scheduling Features:**
- **Time-aware travel calculations**: Traffic at 4:00 PM vs 10:00 AM properly factored
- **Travel constraint validation**: Respects `max_travel_time_minutes` and `max_travel_distance_miles`
- **Efficient routing**: Uses lat/lng coordinates from `existing_calendar` for precise travel calculations
- **Separate phone/business hours**: AI accepts calls 6 AM-10 PM, regular work 8 AM-6 PM
- **After-hours emergency slots**: Limited 1 per day with 1.5x-3.0x pricing multiplier
- **No redundant data**: Removed `last_job_location` - derived from calendar instead

The API consistently provides structured responses that enable the Twilio server to take appropriate actions while maintaining a professional, helpful tone throughout all scenarios.
