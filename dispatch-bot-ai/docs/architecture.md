### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Basic Conversation Flow**: 
   - SMS message → Intent extraction → Address validation → Service area check → Appointment generation → Response
2. **Emergency Detection Flow**: 
   - Message analysis → Emergency keyword detection → Urgency assessment → Time-based pricing → Immediate scheduling
3. **Multi-Trade Flow**: 
   - Trade classification → Job type detection → Trade-specific rules → Specialized scheduling → Industry responses
4. **Advanced Scheduling Flow**: 
   - Calendar integration → Traffic analysis → Optimal slot selection → Weather consideration → Booking confirmation

### Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-3): Basic plumbing services, business hours only, simple scheduling
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 4-6): Emergency detection, multi-trade support, time-based pricing
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 7-9): Advanced scheduling with traffic/weather integration
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 10-12): Production features, monitoring, multi-business support

## SLOs & Scaling Notes

### Service Level Objectives
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (critical for customer conversation handling)
- **Latency**: 
  - Conversation processing: < 2s (P95)
  - Emergency detection: < 1s (P95)
  - Address validation: < 1.5s (P95)
  - Appointment scheduling: < 3s (P95)
- **Throughput**: 
  - 1000 conversations/hour
  - 500 concurrent processing requests
  - 100 appointment bookings/hour
- **Accuracy**: 90% conversation success rate, 95% emergency detection accuracy

### Performance Characteristics
- **Stateless Design**: No persistent state enabling horizontal scaling
- **AI Optimization**: Optimized OpenAI API usage with prompt engineering
- **External API Management**: Rate limiting and retry logic for Google Maps and OpenAI
- **Response Time Optimization**: Sub-2-second customer response times

### Scaling Approach
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless FastAPI design supporting multiple instances
- **AI API Scaling**: Intelligent rate limiting and request batching for OpenAI
- **Cache Strategy**: Address geocoding and business rule caching
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin distribution of conversation processing

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| OpenAI API failures | Critical | Medium | Fallback to rule-based processing |
| Google Maps API limits | High | Medium | Geocoding cache + rate limiting |
| Calendar service outages | Medium | Low | Graceful degradation + manual booking |
| Address validation failures | Medium | Medium | Fallback validation methods |

### AI & Processing Risks

- **Appointment Accuracy**: Incorrectly scheduled appointments causing service issues
- **Emergency Response**: Delayed or missed emergency service requests
- **Cost Management**: High AI API costs affecting profitability

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Clear error messages when uncertain rather than incorrect responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI confidence thresholds for automated responses
- **Human Handoff**: Seamless transition to human agents when needed
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test-driven development with real-world scenarios
