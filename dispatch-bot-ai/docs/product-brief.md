# Product Brief: Dispatch-Bot-AI

## Problem
Field service businesses lose significant revenue from missed calls and need intelligent AI conversation handling to capture customer information, qualify service requests, and schedule appointments automatically. Without intelligent conversation processing, businesses cannot scale their customer intake process or provide 24/7 customer service capabilities.

## Goals
- **Q1 2024**: Deploy Phase 1 AI system handling plumbing service requests during business hours with 80% successful appointment conversion
- **Q2 2024**: Expand to emergency detection across 5 trades (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, locksmith, garage door) with time-based pricing
- **Q3 2024**: Implement advanced scheduling with traffic optimization and multi-day appointment planning achieving <2 second response time
- **Q4 2024**: Production-ready system supporting multiple businesses with comprehensive analytics and 99.9% uptime

## Non-Goals
- **Live Call Handling**: SMS/text conversation processing only, not voice call AI
- **Customer Data Storage**: Stateless processing only, not customer relationship management
- **Business Logic Storage**: External configuration dependency, not internal business rule management
- **Billing Integration**: Service estimation only, not payment processing or billing management
- **Multi-Language Support**: English language processing only in Phase 1

## Primary Users
- **Field Service Businesses**: Need automated customer intake and appointment scheduling for missed calls
- **AI Bot Operators**: Require monitoring and intervention capabilities for complex customer interactions
- **Business Owners**: Need visibility into AI performance, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction metrics
- **System Integrators**: Require reliable APIs for conversation processing and appointment management
- **Customer Support Teams**: Need seamless handoff capabilities when AI cannot resolve customer needs

## Jobs-to-be-Done
- **As a field service business**, I want AI to automatically respond to missed calls, understand customer problems, and schedule appropriate service appointments, so I never lose potential customers
- **As a business owner**, I want intelligent emergency detection with appropriate pricing and immediate response capability, so I can capture high-value urgent service calls
- **As a customer service team**, I want seamless AI-to-human handoff with complete conversation context, so I can provide informed assistance when AI reaches its limits
- **As an AI bot**, I need access to business configuration, calendar availability, and service area validation, so I can provide accurate quotes and confirmed appointments

## Success Metrics
- **Conversion Performance**: 80% successful appointment conversion rate from initial customer contact to confirmed booking
- **Response Accuracy**: 95% accuracy in problem identification and appropriate service classification across all supported trades
- **Processing Speed**: <2 second average response time for customer message processing including external API calls
- **Emergency Detection**: 90% accuracy in emergency identification with appropriate escalation and pricing
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful fallback when external dependencies are unavailable

## Guardrails
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Clear failure modes with human escalation when AI confidence is below acceptable thresholds
- **Cost Controls**: Intelligent API usage optimization to manage OpenAI and Google Maps API costs
- **Privacy Protection**: No persistent storage of customer data with secure handling of conversation context
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Strict adherence to business hours, service areas, and pricing configurations
- **Performance Limits**: Request timeout and retry logic preventing cascading failures during high load
