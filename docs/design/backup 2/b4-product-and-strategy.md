# NeverMissCall ‚Äî Product Description

## Product Overview

**NeverMissCall** is a specialized call management platform designed exclusively for blue-collar service businesses whose workers are physically unable to answer phones during work hours.

* **Instant Customer Response**: Customers get immediate SMS replies when you physically can't answer the phone
* **AI Handles Initial Screening**: Qualify leads, assess urgency, and book appointments automatically
* **Work-Focused Design**: Built specifically for trades where physical work prevents phone access

## Technical Requirements

### Job Catalog & Pricing Engine

* **Business-Specific Job Catalog**: Each business configures their own services with custom pricing and duration
* **Duration-Based Scheduling**: AI matches job duration with available calendar slots before making offers
* **Smart Availability Matching**: Only offers appointment slots that can accommodate the full job duration
* **Custom Rate Setting**: Business owners set their own prices - AI never invents pricing
* **Time Block Validation**: Enforced with Postgres `tstzrange` and GiST exclusion constraints to guarantee **No Double-Booking** (ADR-0006).


**How It Works:**

1. Business pre-configures job catalog (e.g., "Sink Clog: 1 hour, \$175")
2. Customer describes problem: "My kitchen sink is completely clogged"
3. AI matches description to catalog entry and checks calendar availability
4. AI only offers slots with 1+ hour availability: "I can fix that sink clog today at 2 PM or tomorrow at 9 AM. It typically takes 1 hour and costs \$175."
5. AI books appointment with correct time block reserved

**Example Business-Specific Catalogs:**

*Joe's Plumbing (Premium Service):*

* Sink Clog: 1 hour, \$175
* Shower Leak Repair: 2 hours, \$285
* Toilet Installation: 3 hours, \$420

*Budget Plumbing Co:*

* Sink Clog: 1 hour, \$125
* Shower Leak Repair: 2 hours, \$210
* Toilet Installation: 3 hours, \$315

* **Audit Trail**: Complete conversation and action logging

### Scalability

## Development & Deployment Constraints

### Design Philosophy

* **SaaS Service**: Use existing services like Clerk.dev or Stripe (with customer and billing services).
* **AI Development**: Modules divided by domain (conversation, scheduling, compliance), keeping the **modular monolith** simple and maintainable.

### Deployment & Infrastructure

* **Hosting Model**: Managed cloud services (Heroku/Netlify) preferred to minimize operational burden
* **Geographic Scope**: Los Angeles first, San Francisco second (10DLC compliance complexity)
* **Database Strategy**: Modular Monolith with single Postgres cluster, tenant-scoped tables via `tenant_id` column (ADR-0001). Modules are isolated in code, but share one schema for MVP.


### Development Constraints

* **Technology Stack**: Python/FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend (tailwind/shadcn) - no polyglot complexity
* **Integration Approach**: API-first design, avoid deep integrations that create maintenance burden
* **Third-party Dependencies**: Minimize vendor lock-in, prefer services with clear migration paths

### Business Model Constraints

* **Target Market**: SMBs (1-5 employees) - no enterprise features that complicate the product
* **Pricing Simplicity**: Transparent subscription model only; MVP ships a single paid plan `standard`
* **Support Model**: Self-service onboarding with email support, not white-glove service

### Risk Management

* **Compliance-First**: No SMS without 10DLC approval - hard gates prevent legal issues
* **Data Retention**: Clear policies (180 days for messages, 13 months metadata) to limit liability
* **Vendor Dependencies**: Twilio (messaging), Clerk (auth), Stripe (billing) - establish fallback plans

### Quality Gates

* **AI Code Generation**: All services must follow documentation-first development from `/docs/services/phase-1/`
* **Testing Philosophy**: Three-tier testing (unit/integration/e2e) with real business scenario validation
* **Performance Budgets**: Auto-SMS ‚â§5s P95, Booking API responses ‚â§500ms P95 (excluding 3rd party latency), UI freshness ‚â§2.5s P95, zero double-bookings

### Things that are complete

* **Twilio Server** Already complete.
* **Conversation AI** Already complete.
* **Scheduling** This is done, but getting and setting data from calendar is not complete.
* **10DLC Compliance** Manual in Phase 1.

## Addendum 1: Domain-Driven Design & Architectural Approach

### Architectural Style

NeverMissCall is a **DDD-driven Modular Monolith** with clear bounded contexts (ADR-0001..0010). Modules are strongly isolated in code and schema (tenant_id enforced), but run in a single deployable unit. This gives us low operational overhead for MVP scale (‚â§5,000 tenants) while preserving future **service extraction paths** if growth demands.

### Bounded Contexts (Modules)

1. **Telephony** ‚Äì Handles Twilio webhooks, missed-call detection, caller identity, message forwarding.
2. **Conversation** ‚Äì AI-driven SMS threads, human takeover, 60s timers, conversation state machines.
3. **Scheduling** ‚Äì Job catalog, appointment booking, calendar integration (Jobber/Google), conflict prevention with Postgres `tstzrange` + GiST.
4. **Catalog** ‚Äì Service item catalog, pricing, duration, and availability data.
5. **Compliance** ‚Äì 10DLC brand/campaign, opt-outs, outbound message gates.
6. **Billing** ‚Äì Stripe subscription mirror, subscription state events.
7. **Identity** ‚Äì Tenant accounts, roles (OWNER/TECH), Clerk JWT enforcement.
8. **Reporting** ‚Äì Cross-domain **read-model/projection** module for analytics and SLO tracking (not a transactional bounded context).

### Data & Consistency

* **Single PostgreSQL instance**, single schema, all tables tenant-scoped by `tenant_id` (ADR-0001).
* ACID transactions within modules (especially Scheduling to prevent double-booking).
* **Outbox pattern** used for domain events ‚Üí projections and async flows.
* CQRS-lite: transactional writes, denormalized read models for performance.

### Integration Patterns

* **Idempotency keys** for Twilio/Stripe/Jobber/Google integrations.
* **Adapters** abstract external services to keep the core domain independent.
* **Contract tests** between modules enforce boundaries.

### Scalability & Growth Path

* Modular Monolith sufficient for target scale (‚â§5,000 users, ‚â§100 concurrent).
* If future scale demands, likely extractions are: Telephony Ingestion, Compliance workflows, Analytics pipeline.

---

**Summary:** This project is a **DDD-driven Modular Monolith**, optimized for SMB-focused MVP delivery. Modules enforce strong domain boundaries, enabling rapid development today and optional microservice extraction tomorrow.
