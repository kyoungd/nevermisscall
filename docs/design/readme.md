Here's a minimal documentation structure for a DDD project that captures the essential elements without being overwhelming:
Core Domain Documentation
1. Domain Vision Statement
A one-page document that explains:

What problem the domain solves
The core business value it provides
Key stakeholders and their goals

2. Ubiquitous Language Glossary
A living document containing:

Key domain terms and their precise definitions
Business rules associated with each term
Examples of correct usage
Terms that should NOT be used (and why)

3. Context Map
Visual and textual documentation showing:

Bounded contexts and their boundaries
Relationships between contexts (upstream/downstream, partnership, etc.)
Integration patterns between contexts (Anti-corruption Layer, Open Host Service, etc.)
Team ownership of each context

4. Core Bounded Context Documentation
For each bounded context, document:
Aggregates:

Aggregate root entities and their invariants
Aggregate boundaries and consistency rules
Key business rules they enforce

Domain Events:

Event catalog with schemas
What triggers each event
Who consumes them

Key Use Cases/Commands:

Command/query responsibilities
Business process flows
Acceptance criteria

5. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Brief documents for significant decisions:

Why certain boundaries were chosen
Trade-offs in aggregate design
Technology choices that affect the domain model

6. Integration Contracts

API schemas for context boundaries
Event schemas for event-driven communication
Data transformation rules

This minimal set ensures you capture the "why" behind your domain model while keeping documentation maintainable. Keep everything version-controlled alongside your code, and update it as part of your development process rather than as an afterthought.
The key is to document just enough to preserve domain knowledge and design decisions without creating a documentation burden that nobody will maintain.
