# NeverMissCall Project Overview

Turn every missed call into a conversation—and every conversation into a customer.

## Core Development Principle

**Documentation is Truth**: This project follows the principle that documentation specifications are the authoritative source of truth. All code implementation must strictly follow the service specifications documented in `docs/services/`. When conflicts arise between existing code and documentation, the documentation defines the correct behavior and code must be updated accordingly.

## The Pain
Local service pros (plumbers, dentists, electricians, etc.) miss calls while they’re on the job.
 Every unanswered ring sends a prospect straight to a competitor—bleeding revenue and wasting ad spend.

The Fix
Instant Text-Back
 When a call goes unanswered, nevermisscall sends an SMS in seconds:
“Hi! Sorry we missed you at Precision Plumbing. We’re helping another customer right now—how can we help you?”
The lead stays warm, replies by text, and the owner can jump in whenever they’re free.
 No app to learn, no workflow to build—just plug in and go.
 If you re busy, AI will take over the text conversation and give quotes and schedule appointment.

How It Works
Waits 60 seconds for the owner to reply.
If they’re still busy, AI jumps in: answers FAQs, gives ballpark pricing, promises an end-of-day service window.
Multilingual support & full conversation log inside GHL.
Owner Takeover Anytime – One tap and the pro is back in control.
It works with your existing calendar
