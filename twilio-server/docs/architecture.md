### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Missed Call Flow**: 
   - Incoming call → Forward to business phone → No answer detection → SMS automation → Conversation initiation
2. **SMS Conversation Flow**: 
   - SMS receipt → Conversation routing → AI processing → Response generation → SMS delivery
3. **Call Forwarding Flow**: 
   - Call webhook → Number lookup → Business phone forwarding → Status tracking → Analytics
4. **AI Handoff Flow**: 
   - 60-second timer → Human response check → AI takeover decision → Conversation processing

### MVP Implementation Status
- ✅ **Basic Webhook Handler**: Express server with Twilio integration
- ✅ **Call Forwarding**: Routes calls to business phones with 20s timeout
- ✅ **Missed Call Detection**: Detects no-answer/busy/failed statuses
- ✅ **Auto SMS Response**: Sends automated SMS when calls are missed
- ⏳ **SMS Conversation Management**: Phase 2 implementation
- ⏳ **AI Integration**: Phase 2 AI dispatcher logic

## SLOs & Scaling Notes

### Service Level Objectives
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (critical for call processing)
- **Latency**: 
  - Webhook processing: < 500ms (P95)
  - Call forwarding: < 2s connection time
  - SMS delivery: < 5s (P95)
  - AI response: < 10s (P95)
- **Throughput**: 
  - 1000 concurrent calls
  - 500 SMS messages/minute
  - 100 webhook processes/second
- **Reliability**: 99.5% call connection success rate

### Performance Characteristics
- **Webhook Processing**: Fast webhook validation and response generation
- **Twilio Integration**: Optimized Twilio SDK usage with connection pooling
- **Call Routing**: Efficient number lookup and forwarding logic
- **Message Processing**: Async SMS processing with queue management

### Scaling Approach
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless webhook processing across multiple instances
- **Load Balancing**: Twilio webhook distribution across service instances
- **Queue Management**: SMS and AI processing queues for high throughput
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient call and conversation data storage

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Twilio service outage | Critical | Low | Service health monitoring + failover |
| Webhook delivery failures | High | Medium | Retry logic + error handling |
| Call forwarding failures | High | Medium | Fallback routing + monitoring |
| Database connection issues | Medium | Low | Connection pooling + retry logic |

### Business Risks
- **Missed Calls**: Failed call forwarding causing lost business opportunities
- **SMS Delays**: Delayed auto-responses reducing customer satisfaction
- **Conversation Gaps**: Lost conversation context affecting AI performance
- **Call Quality**: Poor call quality affecting customer experience

### Integration Risks
- **AI Service Dependency**: Dispatch-bot-AI service failures affecting automation
- **Call Service Integration**: AS-Call-Service failures affecting analytics
- **Network Connectivity**: Internet connectivity issues affecting Twilio integration
- **Configuration Errors**: Misconfigured phone numbers causing routing failures

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring of Twilio service health
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- **Redundancy**: Multiple phone number routing options
- **Testing**: Regular testing of call flows and SMS automation
